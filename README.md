# Abstract
This senior project paper is a culmination of one yearâ€™s research on enrollment, debt, and net price in higher education. Four papers on college pricing, college debt, enrollment patterns, and the distinction between sticker price and net price were synthesized with the ambition of examining the challenges higher education is facing and what this means for institutions. 

The future of higher education looks bleak. The role of population and demographic dynamics, student debt, net price, and pricing strategies will be examined to discern how institutions will need to change to remain competitive and relevant.
